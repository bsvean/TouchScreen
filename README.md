## TouchScreen

**TouchScreen** is designed to operate on Raspberry Pi 4 using the UCTRONICS 3.5 Inch Touch Screen attachment. It is designed to operate as a custom touchscreen interface for a number of different applications. 

TouchScreen focuses on a modular plugin system and uses [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) as an application wrapper. So no more web server or browser installs necessary! It is derived from the MagicMirrorÂ² software designed by MichMich.
